"""
This module loads the OpenPose model, pre-processes the input data and gets the corresponding predictions.

The OpenPose pipeline is the following:
1- Scale the input image at different scales and predict them with the network
2- Combine the resulting predictions into one
3- Find the predictions of the joints by performing non-maximum supression
4- Combine the joints and the limbs to find which of them are connected
5- Given the previous information find which joints/limbs belong to the same person
6- Return the joints for all the people found in the image
